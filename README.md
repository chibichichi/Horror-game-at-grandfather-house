> Introduce about game story

You wake up in what looks to be an abandoned farm.
Getting up you spot a piece of paper (letter).
It will tell you what you need to get to escape the farm while briefly mentioning an entity that is rumored to haunt the farm.
Later letters mention how the previous owners of the farm died/lived.
